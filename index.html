        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>First and foremost, hello everyone! My name is Natalie Matos, and I am a junior developer in training. Currently I am enrolled in Rutgers Full-Stack Codinging Bootcamp. Originally I was studying in the field of Biology but soon learned that the field was not my true passion. Through a relative I was introduced to coding and a fire was light within me. It started with trying out a few coding apps and through them my passion for coding grew. However, it wasnt until recently that I took a leap of fate and enrolled in a bootcamp. For a long time I had been tired of my dead-end job and so far coding has been the breath of fresh air that I needed. While each day has brought it's own set of challenges I am continuously rewarded for my efforts with the knowldege that I gain. I truly have enjoyed creating many things throughout the course so far and while I do not know where the future will take me I know the journey will be a fun one.</p>
