# Natalie Matos Portfolio

## Description

In this application we were tasked with creating our first portfolio. The knowledge we have obtained of HTML and CSS was used to create said portfolios. In the future we will be able to use these portfolios as templates for the professional ones we make. In addition, throughout the course we will be able to add to our portfolios the projects that we work on.
